(b) The Trustee shall deposit all Note Payments, P&I Advances, amounts
transferred by the Escrow Custodian from the Escrow Account, together with all proceeds
from the sale or disposition of the Notes or any other moneys it receives, in all cases to the
extent such moneys are designated or attributable to interest pursuant to the terms of a
Note, in the Note Interest Sub-Account of the Distribution Account.
(c) The Trustee shall deposit all Note Payments, together with all proceeds
from the sale or disposition of the Notes or any other moneys it receives, in all cases to the
extent such moneys are designated or attributable to premium payable by a Borrower
pursuant to the terms of the related Note, in the Note Premium Sub-Account of the
Distribution Account.
(d) The Trustee shall deposit all Note Payments, P&I Advances, amounts
transferred by the Escrow Custodian from the Escrow Account, together with all proceeds
from the sale or disposition of the Notes or any other moneys it receives, in all cases to the
extent such moneys are designated or attributable to principal pursuant to the terms of a
Note, in the Note Principal Sub-Account of the Distribution Account.
(e) All amounts in the Distribution Account and the earnings on the investment
of such amounts shall be invested by the Trustee, at the written direction of the Issuer, only
in Permitted Investments, so that such Permitted Investments may be liquidated to make
the payments to be made on each Distribution Date. Absent such written direction, such
amounts shall be held uninvested. Earnings on amounts on deposit in the Distribution
Account shall be treated and distributed as if such earnings were Note Interest.
(f) Upon receipt of Note Payments from the Master Servicer, the Trustee shall:
(i) determine if the amount representing Note Interest on deposit in the
Distribution Account, together with the amount set forth in any related Advances
Report, is sufficient to pay the Administrative Fees as set forth in Section 4.02 and
to make all Distributions to the Class A Holders as set forth in Section 4.03(a)(i)
and, if the amount so determined is insufficient for such purposes, direct the Escrow
Custodian in writing to transfer to the Trustee from and to the extent of funds on
deposit in the Escrow Account the amounts sufficient to make the payments set
forth in Section 4.03(a)(i) and deposit such amounts in the Note Interest Sub-
Account of the Distribution Account; and
(ii) determine if a Principal Shortfall Amount will still exist after
reducing the Certificate Balance of the Class B Certificate to zero pursuant to
Section 4.03(b)(ii)(A) and, if so, direct the Escrow Custodian in writing to transfer
to the Trustee from and to the extent of funds on deposit in the Escrow Account the
amounts sufficient to make the payments set forth in Section 4.03(b)(ii)(B)(2) and
4.03(b)(ii)(B)(3) and deposit such amounts the Note Principal Sub-Account of the
Distribution Account.

Section 4.02. Administrative Fees.
On each Distribution Date, the Trustee shall pay, from the amounts on deposit in
the Note Interest Sub-Account of the Distribution Account, the Administrative Fees, in
arrears, in the following order of priority, each priority being fully paid before proceeds
are used to pay any lower priority and no payment being made on any priority if the
proceeds have been exhausted in the payment of higher priorities:
(i) to the Trustee, the Trustee Fee;
(ii) to the Escrow Custodian, the Escrow Custodian Fee;
(iii) to the Issuer, the Issuer Fee;
(iv) to the Dissemination Agent, the Dissemination Agent Fee; and
(v) to CREFC®, the CREFC® Royalty Fee.
Each of the above fees will be paid monthly and will be calculated on a Loan by
Loan basis as the product of (i) the unpaid principal balance of each Note as of the first day
of the immediately preceding calendar month, (ii) the applicable rate per annum, and (iii)
the accrual basis for the respective Note.
Section 4.03. Distributions.
(a) Distributions of Note Interest. On each Distribution Date, after paying the
Administrative Fees set forth in Section 4.02, the Trustee shall apply amounts on deposit
in the Note Interest Sub-Account of the Distribution Account and any earnings thereon, in
the order of priority listed, as follows:
(i) to the Class A Certificateholders, on a pari passu basis between
Classes of the Class A Certificates, Distributions on the Certificate Balance of the
Class A Certificates at the applicable Class A Rate, determined by reference to the
Class Factor calculated by the Trustee as set forth in subsection (f) below; provided,
however, that if, as a result of any default or delinquency on one or more of the
Loans, the Available Note Interest is insufficient to make such Distributions on the
Class A Certificates, then the Trustee shall, to the extent of the funds available:
(A) make Distributions in respect of Note Interest on the
Certificate Balance of the Class A-1 Certificates at the Class A-1 Rate
determined by reference to the Class Factor calculated by the Trustee as set
forth in subsection (f) below, first, from Available Note Interest and, if such
Available Note Interest is insufficient, then from amounts withdrawn from
the Common Sub-Account as set forth in Section 4.01(f)(i); and then
(B) make Distributions in respect of Note Interest on the
Certificate Balance of the Class A-2 Certificates at the Class A-2 Rate
determined by reference to the Class Factor calculated by the Trustee as set
29
4135-7643-8109
forth in subsection (f) below, first, from Available Note Interest and, if such
Available Note Interest is insufficient, then from amounts withdrawn from
the Class A-2 Sub-Account as set forth in Section 4.01(f)(i) and then from
amounts withdrawn from the Common Sub-Account as set forth in Section
4.01(f)(i).
(ii) to Escrow Custodian, to the extent funds have previously been
withdrawn from the Escrow Account and have not been reimbursed or repaid:
(A) an amount equal to the amounts withdrawn from the
Common Sub-Account for deposit to the Common Sub-Account; and
(B) an amount equal to the amounts withdrawn from the Class
A-2 Sub-Account for deposit to the Class A-2 Sub-Account.
(iii) to the Class B Certificateholders, Distributions on the Certificate
Balance of the Class B Certificates at the Class B Rate, determined by reference to
the Class Factor calculated by the Trustee as set forth in subsection (f); and
(iv) to the Class B Certificateholders, all amounts remaining.
(b) Distributions of Scheduled Note Principal Payments.
(i) On each Distribution Date, the Trustee shall apply Available Note
Principal to make payments of the Certificate Balance of the Class A Certificates,
on a pro rata basis between Classes of the Class A Certificates, until the Certificate
Balance of the Class A Certificates is reduced to zero, and, after the Certificate
Balance of the Class A Certificates is reduced to zero, to make payments of the
Certificate Balance of the Class B Certificates.
(ii) If a Principal Shortfall Amount exists, then the Trustee shall:
(A) reduce the Certificate Balance of the Class B Certificates,
without any payment therefore, by an amount equal to the Principal
Shortfall Amount until the Certificate Balance of the Class B Certificates is
reduced to zero and then reduce the Principal Shortfall Amount by an
amount equal to such reduction in the Certificate Balance of the Class B
Certificates;
(B) if, after taking the actions in clause (A) above, a Principal
Shortfall Amount still exists, then the Trustee shall:
(1) calculate the sum of the amount on deposit in the
Note Principal Sub-Account of the Distribution Account
(“Available Note Principal”) and the Principal Shortfall Amount and
then allocate such sum to the Class A-1 Certificates and the Class
A-2 Certificates, on a pro rata basis according to the respective
Certificate Balances (the amount so allocated to the Class A-1
30
4135-7643-8109
Certificates, the “Class A-1 Principal Due” and the amount so
allocated to the Class A-2 Certificates, the “Class A-2 Principal
Due”); then
(2) pay to the Class A-1 Certificateholders the Class A-
1 Principal Due, first from Available Note Principal and, if such
Available Note Principal is insufficient, then from amounts
withdrawn from the Common Sub-Account as set forth in Section
4.01(f)(ii) (and reduce the Principal Amount Shortfall by the
amounts withdrawn from the Escrow Account); and then
(3) pay to the Class A-2 Certificateholders the Class A-
2 Principal Due, first from Available Note Principal remaining after
taking the actions in clause (2) above and, if such Available Note
Principal is insufficient, then from amounts withdrawn from the
Class A-2 Sub-Account as set forth in Section 4.01(f)(ii) and then
from amounts withdrawn from the Common Sub-Account as set
forth in Section 4.01(f)(ii) (and reduce the Principal Amount
Shortfall by the amounts withdrawn from the Escrow Account); and
then
(4) to the extent a Principal Shortfall Amount still exists,
reduce the Certificate Balance of the Class A-2 Certificates by an
amount equal to the remaining Principal Shortfall Amount (and
reduce the Principal Shortfall Amount by the amount of the
reduction of Certificate Balance of the Class A-2 Certificates) until
the Certificate Balance of the Class A-2 Certificates is reduced to
zero; and then
(5) to the extent a Principal Shortfall Amount still exists,
reduce the Certificate Balance of the Class A-1 Certificates by an
amount equal to the remaining Principal Shortfall Amount until the
Certificate Balance of the Class A-2 Certificates is reduced to zero.
(iii) Notwithstanding any other provision of Section 4.03(b)(ii), in no
event shall the Trustee distribute any amounts on deposit in the Note Principal Sub-
Account of the Distribution Account representing amounts transferred from the
Class A-2 Sub-Account of the Escrow Account to the Class A-2 Certificateholder
if doing so would reduce the Certificate Balance of the Class A-2 Certificates to
zero and the Certificate Balance of the Class A-1 Certificates has not already or
concurrently been reduced to zero.
(c) Distributions of Unscheduled Note Payments. The Trustee shall, from
amounts on deposit in the applicable sub-account of the Distribution Account, (i) apply
any portion of an Unscheduled Note Payment constituting Note Interest to make a
Distribution of Note Interest in accordance with Section 4.03(a) on the next Distribution
Date, (ii) apply any portion of an Unscheduled Note Payment constituting Note Principal
31
4135-7643-8109
(A) to make payments of the Certificate Balance of the Class A Certificates, on a pro rata
basis between Classes of the Class A Certificates, until the Certificate Balance of the Class
A Certificates is reduced to zero, and (B) after the Certificate Balance of the Class A
Certificates is reduced to zero, to make payments of the Certificate Balance of the Class B
Certificates, and (iii) apply any portion of a Unscheduled Note Payment constituting Note
Premium to make payments to the Class A Certificateholders and the Class B
Certificateholders in accordance with Section 4.03(d).
(d) Distributions of Note Premium. On each Distribution Date, for each Loan
in respect of which Note Premium was received by the Trustee and deposited to the Note
Premium Sub-Account of the Distribution Account by such Distribution Date, provided
the Trustee has received an Officer’s Certificate of the Master Servicer or the Special
Servicer with respect thereto, which shall include the total amount of Note Premium
received and the discount rate set forth in the related Note, the Trustee shall pay such Note
Premium to the Certificateholders as follows:
(i) to the Class A Certificateholders, on a pro rata basis between Classes
of the Class A Certificates, a portion of the Note Premium equal to (A) the amount
of the Note Premium received by the Determination Date, multiplied by (B) the
quotient of (1) the amount of Note Principal distributed to Class A
Certificateholders, over (2) the total amount of Note Principal distributed to Class
A Certificateholders and the Class B Certificateholders; and
(ii) to the Class B Certificateholders, a portion of the Note Premium
equal to (A) the amount of the Note Premium received by the Determination Date,
multiplied by (B) the quotient of (1) the amount of Note Principal distributed to
Class B Certificateholders, over (2) the total amount of Note Principal distributed
to Class A Certificateholders and the Class B Certificateholders.
(e) Distributions of Delinquent Note Payments. The Trustee shall, from
amounts on deposit in the applicable sub-account of the Distribution Account, (i) apply
any portion of a Note Payment constituting Note Interest and received after the applicable
Determination Date to make a Distribution of Note Interest in accordance with Section
4.03(a) on the next Distribution Date, and (ii) apply any portion of a Note Payment
constituting Note Principal and received after the applicable Determination Date (A) to
make payments of the Certificate Balance of the Class A Certificates, on a pro rata basis
between Classes of the Class A Certificates, until the Certificate Balance of the Class A
Certificates is reduced to zero, and (B) after the Certificate Balance of the Class A
Certificates is reduced to zero, to make payments of the Certificate Balance of the Class B
Certificates, and (iii) apply any portion of a Note Payment constituting Note Premium and
received after the applicable Determination Date to make payments to the Class A
Certificateholders and the Class B Certificateholders in accordance with Section 4.03(d).
(f) Class Factors. On each Distribution Date, the Trustee shall make
Distributions on the Certificates based upon the Class Factor determined on the prior
Distribution Date or, with respect to the first Distribution Date following the Closing Date,
the initial Class Factor. After distributing all Available Note Principal and amounts
32
4135-7643-8109
withdrawn from the Escrow Account, the Trustee will calculate the Class Factors which
will be in effect from the next following Business Day to and including the following
Distribution Date. The Class Factors so calculated will be made available to Bloomberg
via the Trustee’s Reporting Website on the Business Day following such Distribution Date.
(g) Additional Provisions with Respect to Distributions.
(i) Distributions of Note Interest on the Certificates will be calculated
on a 30/360 basis (i.e., assuming that a year consists of 12 months of 30 days each).
(ii) Distributions of Scheduled Note Principal Payments pursuant to
Section 4.03(b) shall be in $0.01 increments.
(iii) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Trustee shall
not make any Distributions to a Certificateholder if, by doing so, it would reduce
the Certificateholder’s Capital Account below zero, except for any final
Distributions of the Portfolio Assets pursuant to Section 9.03 in connection with a
Termination Event.
(iv) A Holder is not required to present its Certificate to the Trustee to
receive any Distribution, other than in connection with the final payment of such
Certificate. Any Class A Certificate or Class B Certificate receiving payment in
full of its Certificate Balance and its Distribution in respect of Note Interest
pursuant to this Section shall be cancelled upon receipt of such payment and shall
no longer be outstanding.
(v) The Trustee shall, to the extent amounts are needed and available
from the Escrow Account and the Escrow Custodian has not transferred such
amounts in accordance with the Escrow Account Agreement, direct the Escrow
Custodian to make such transfer in the amount and by the time required to make
the Distributions hereunder.
(vi) The Trustee shall notify the Servicer of all amounts withdrawn from
the Escrow Account.
Section 4.04. Compliance with Withholding Requirements. All cash payments to the
Holders hereunder shall be made without deduction for any taxes, charges, levies or withholdings,
except to the extent, if any, that such amounts are required to be withheld under the laws, rules and
regulations of the United States of America and any other applicable taxing authority.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Trust Agreement, the Trustee shall comply with all
U.S. federal income tax withholding requirements with respect to Distributions. The consent of
the Holder shall not be required for any such withholding, except that no withholding shall be
made to the extent that a Holder presents to the Trustee a form evidencing the entitlement to
elimination or reduction of such withholding. In the event the Trustee withholds any amount from
a Beneficial Owner pursuant to withholding requirements, the amount so withheld shall be treated
as having been distributed to such Beneficial Owner for all purposes of this Trust Agreement and
the Trustee shall provide such Beneficial Owner with IRS-required withholding reports when due.
